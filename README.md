# N-Queens Backtracking Visualizer

This repository hosts an interactive web application for visualizing the classic N-Queens problem solved using the backtracking algorithm.

## Description

The N-Queens problem is a well-known combinatorial problem where the task is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The backtracking algorithm efficiently explores the search space to find all possible arrangements of queens on the chessboard without violating the constraint of no two queens threatening each other.

## Features

- Interactive Visualization: Explore how the backtracking algorithm solves the N-Queens problem in real-time.
- Customizable Board Size: Choose the size of the chessboard (N) to solve the N-Queens problem for different dimensions.
- Step-by-Step Execution: Step through the execution of the backtracking algorithm to understand how solutions are found.
- Highlighting Solutions: Once a solution is found, the application highlights the placement of queens on the board.
- Educational Purpose: Designed for educational purposes to help users understand the backtracking algorithm and its application.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end development.
- Backtracking Algorithm: Implemented in JavaScript.
- GitHub Pages: Hosting the web application.

## Usage

To use the application, simply navigate to the GitHub Pages link provided in the repository. Customize the board size and step through the execution of the backtracking algorithm to visualize solutions to the N-Queens problem.
